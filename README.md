# discord.js-skeleton
A probably wrong and terrible skeleton layout of a Discord.js bot.


I wrote this largely, and by largely I mean some parts are copy and pasted from, this guide: https://www.gitbook.com/book/yorkaargh/discord-js-bot-guide/details

I create bots far to often when I am bored so this just helps me jumpstart them. 

Nothing fancy, nothing special, nothing pretty.
